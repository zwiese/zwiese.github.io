    <h1>Welcome to My Test Page</h1>
    <p><strong>Video games</strong> have become one of the biggest sources of entertainment worldwide. In 2020, the global gaming market was valued at <strong>$159.3 billion</strong>, compared to the <strong>music industry</strong> (<strong>$19.1 billion</strong>) and the <strong>movie industry</strong> (<strong>$41.7 billion</strong>). This valuation includes <strong>console</strong>, <strong>PC</strong>, and <strong>mobile games</strong>, as well as <strong>esports</strong>. With so many ways to play and so many different types of games, itâ€™s no surprise that gaming has become such a dominant force. Unlike other sources of entertainment, gaming is <strong>interactive</strong>, which lets players make decisions and control how their source of fun goes.
